#Exp from Angular book
To run any web application, youâ€™ll need a basic HTTP server, such as http-server or
live-server. The latter performs live reloads of the web page as soon as you modify the
code and save the file of the running application.
To install http-server, use the following npm command:

    c:>npm install http-server -g
    project dir>http-server

If you prefer to see live reloads in the browser, install and start live-server using a similar routine

    c:>npm install live-server -g
    project dir>live-server

will start default browser
